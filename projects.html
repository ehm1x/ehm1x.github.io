                  As a Proof of Concept, I developed a Statistical Anti-Cheat system designed to identify potential cheaters in gaming environments. The system calculates the average and standard deviation for specific in-game data points. Each player is then evaluated based on their <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_score" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Z-Score</a>, which measures how far their performance deviates beyond the standard deviation. Subsequently, this Z-Score is fed into a tunable exponential function to generate a 'Cheater Score.' Players are ranked by their Cheater Scores, enabling quick identification and review of hightly disruptive players. The source code for this project is available on <a href="https://github.com/ehm1x/Statistical-Anticheat" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">GitHub</a>.

                  I built a full-stack fantasy football app that's been through two iterations. The first version was built using a React, Node, Mongo, and Express stack. After that, I rebuilt the same application with Angular to deepen my understanding of different frameworks.
              
                  This app allows users to enter their Sleeper username and select which league they would like to analyze. Next, the app will perform a comprehensive analysis of all the players, providing insights into individual trade values, total team values, and even potential trade targets.
              
                  One of the standout features is the trade analyzer. It lets users pick another team in their league, propose a hypothetical trade, and see an evaluation of the trade based on statistical "Trade Value".
              
                  Additionally, the app included a player rankings page. This custom-developed table was filterable by player position and also sortable across various statistical categories. Each cell in the table is color-coded to reflect the performance level of that data point for the player's position, making it easy to compare and contrast at a glance.
